Document Signing and Validation Using Blockchain

Overview
This project presents a blockchain-based solution for secure and efficient digital document signing and validation. Utilizing Ethereum, smart contracts, and IPFS, the platform ensures the integrity and authenticity of digital documents in a decentralized, tamper-proof environment.

Key Features
Document Storage and Retrieval: Securely store and retrieve documents using IPFS.
User Management: Manage user identities and permissions efficiently.
Smart Contracts: Use Ethereum smart contracts to validate document signatures and timestamps.
Decentralization: Ensure no single point of failure with a decentralized architecture.
User-Friendly Interface: Interact with the platform through a ReactJS-based frontend.

Technologies Used
Ethereum: For creating and managing smart contracts.
IPFS: For decentralized document storage.
ReactJS: For building the user interface.
MetaMask: For managing Ethereum accounts and transactions.
Remix IDE: For developing and deploying smart contracts.
